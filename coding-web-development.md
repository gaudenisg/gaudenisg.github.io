I've been coding since 2015 (almost half my life), with a focus on web development, including website hosting. I post some small projects on [my Codepen profile](https://codepen.io/gaudenisg).

In addition, I've built several websites, listed below. 

* ## [Fabula Nebulae](https://fabulanebulae.com)

Fabula Nebulae is my family's small business. The website was originally built in 2015; by 2025, it was in need of a refresh. I built a new version of the website using:
* [Shopify](https://shopify.com)
* Liquid
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

* ## [New Morning Blooms](https://newmorningblooms.com)

I built this website for a family friend's flower business, New Morning Blooms, using [Squarespace](https://squarespace.com) and some custom code.

* ## [Studio Stiklas](https://studiostiklas.com)

Studio Stiklas ("glass" in Lithuanian") is my family member's art studio. I built this website using [Carrd](https://carrd.co), and update it regularly with new artwork.

* ## [Personal Website](/)

* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)
* Liquid
* HTML
* CSS (SCSS)
* Some JavaScript

There you have it! I'm often thinking about projects I can create, and problems I can solve, using the coding knowledge I have and the tools that are available.
